* Network Topology

1. Bus Topology 

coaxial cable is used for bus topology

the connector used for bus topology is BNC connector

it broadcasts the data therefore no data security

single point of failure makes whole network down

difficult to troubleshoot the point of failure we have to check whole network

bus topology is difficult to manage

not used now a days

============================================================

2. Ring Topology

coaxial cable with BNC connector is used for ring topology

ring topology clockwise

dual ring topology internal clockwise external anticlockwise

dual ring topology was expensive as we have to use two wires for a single network

data broadcast in ring topology

and same disadvantages as the bus topology

=============================================================

3. Star Topology

it uses twisted pair cable also known as cat cable or ethernet cable
or lan cable or rj45 cable

it uses rj45 connector

switch is used in star topology which is a intelligent device

switch works on unicast communication (hub works on broadcast communication)

if one connection in the network fails the only one pc gets disconnected
all the other network is on

===============================================================

4. Tree Topology

when we connect multiple star topologies we get tree topology.

===============================================================

5. Mesh Topology

used in large working area such as Banking, Airport, Data Center

even if one or two networking cables fail at the time the whole network is working
without being affected.

===============================================================

6. Hybrid Topology

when we connect multiple topologies together is called as hybrid topology 
e.g. bus topology, ring topology, star topology connected together is known as hybrid topology
