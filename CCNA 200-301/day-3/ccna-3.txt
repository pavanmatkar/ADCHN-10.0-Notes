unmanageable router ka browser se dashboard access kr sakte hai. usme password change

manageable router me sab controlling aapke haath me hoti hai

manageable router parts cpu, ram, rom, storage, ports, smps, cooling fan

ram stores all running configuration files

router operating system is ios

nvram means hard disk or secondary memory it stores startup configurations

in old routers we used to have flash memory. flash memory stores ios which is in .bin
format. in new routers there is a separate storage device

rom performs power on self test (post) 

there are some empty slots in the router where we can add Lan or Wan interface 
cards according to our need

in manageable router we can customize the hardware also e.g. adding ports as per requirement

interview question explain router boot process?

first method to access router is console port

second method to access router is aux port
aux port can be used for remote access of the router
aux port is connected to modem > internet > modem > computer where we want to access the router
putty software is used for remote access

third method to access the router is VTY it uses telnet or ssh
telnet for private network and ssh for public network as it requires security

fourth method is tty
agar bahut sare routers hai hamare premises me to hum tty method ka use karenge.
sare routers ko ek device se connect karenge fir use computer se connect karenge
fir hame jo router chahiye usme login karenge
