5. Storage Device

two types 1. IDE HDD 2. SATA HDD

IDE HDD also known as PATA HDD

IDE is obsolute now so we will study SATA only

SATA HDD has following parts
1. Plater / disk -> stores data
2. Motor -> rotates plater
3. Actuator -> controls arm movement
4. Arm -> controls the movement of head
5. Head -> reads and writes data on disk 

data is stored in the form of electromagnetic signal

higher the rpm of motor higher is the speed of the hdd e.g. 5400rpm, 7200rpm, 10000rpm, etc.

=======================================================================

Interview question what is difference between HDD and SSD

* SSD
no plater
no motor
it has multiple ICs which stores data

if you want data security(recovery) go for HDD
if you want faster speed go for SSD 

HDD is cheap price e.g. 500 GB for 800/- RS
SSD is high price e.g. 500 GB for 2000/- RS

for fast booting use ssd for data storage use hdd.
data recovery from ssd is harder as compared to hdd.

===========================================================================

* NVME also known as m2 sata

it takes much lower space as compared to hdd and sata.

extra power connection is not required for nvme but required in hdd and sata

===========================================================================

* MBR (master boot recorder) and GPT (graphic partition table)

MBR supports upto 3 primary partition and one extended partition (logical volume) total of 4 partition and maximum disk size of 2TB

MBR introduced by IBM in 1983

MBR works on old technology (BIOS) and GPT works on new technology (UEFI)

OS can be installed only in primary partition

MBR does not support secure boot menu. GPT supports secure boot menu.

GPT supports upto 128 primary partition
GPT supports UEFI boot menu (unified extendable firmware interface) 

Server uses GPT disks

=============================================================================

* Basic disks and Dynamic disks

basic disk me keval 3 primary partition banenge
dynamic me primary partition nahi bante extended bante hai to kitne bhi ban sakte hai

interview question basic disk and dynamic disks

diskmgmt.msc (to check basic or dynamic disk)

we can install os in basic disk but dynamic disk does not support os installation

dynamic disk is used to create LVM 

dynamic disk me primary partition bante hi nahi hai

primary partition basic disk hi support karta hai

basic disk me 4 hi partition bante hai 
dynamic me kitne bhi partition ban sakte hai

===============================================================================

* File Systems

FAT
FAT32
ExFAT
NTFS -> 1993 -> security options -> supports encryption -> used most widely now a days

file system data ko systematic tarikese arrange karne ka kaam karta hai
