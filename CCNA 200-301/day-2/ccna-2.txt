* Network Topology

1. Bus Topology 

coaxial cable is used for bus topology

the connector used for bus topology is BNC connector

it broadcasts the data therefore no data security

single point of failure makes whole network down

difficult to troubleshoot the point of failure we have to check whole network

bus topology is difficult to manage

not used now a days

============================================================

2. Ring Topology

coaxial cable with BNC connector is used for ring topology

ring topology clockwise

dual ring topology internal clockwise external anticlockwise

dual ring topology was expensive as we have to use two wires for a single network

data broadcast in ring topology

and same disadvantages as the bus topology

=============================================================

3. Star Topology
